Acerca del empleo

We‚Äôd like to improve it even further with you on the team.

Expert Python engineer wanted üöÄ



Do you have at least 5 years of programming experience ‚Äì not necessarily professional ‚Äì including at least a year with Python? If so, you have probably written so much Python code in your life that at times you want to express your thoughts through list comprehensions. Thanks to your extensive experience, you can solve any problem that gets thrown at you, but that is not enough ‚Äì you come up with multiple solutions for every issue, and you always know how to choose the most Pythonic one.


What type of projects would you work on? üßë‚Äçüíª


The demand for our work is extremely high, so we get to pick and choose the projects that we want to take on ‚Äì and the same goes for you. Before you‚Äôre assigned to a project, you‚Äôll be personally asked if you‚Äôre interested in that particular task and if you don‚Äôt like it, you‚Äôll just get something else.



We mainly accept offers from startups and small-to-medium businesses from the US, the UK, and Canada. Some projects may only last a couple of hours, while others take even a few years for us to complete. There is one thing that you can be sure of, though - that it will always be your personal choice whether to work on a particular project or reject it. What would you have thought about these?


financial data warehouse, which aggregates over 31 000 time series into a few hundred charts for a fintech company from London
graph data search/visualization system for auditors/investigators from Norway
super scalable WAF optimized down to extremely low running costs for a client from Chicago, IL
multisource cloud object synthesizer library for a storage provider from San Mateo, CA
report generator/inventory tracker for an e-commerce/healthcare company from Canada
k8s-based revenue optimizer for large private GPU compute clusters in North America
paper product level tracker for toilet cleaners from Canada
hydrant certification report generator for Australian plumbers
multi-tenant hospitality management system for large properties in the US
large scale information display system for retailers (international)


We have already delivered those, but you can be sure we‚Äôve got even more exciting projects coming up in the future.
