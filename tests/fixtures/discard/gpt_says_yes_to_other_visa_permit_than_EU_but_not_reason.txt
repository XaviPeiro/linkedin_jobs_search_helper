About Minware


minware's aims to eliminate waste from software engineering by helping engineers write less bad code. We do that by analyzing what happens to code after it is written to help people improve the way they work.


Kevin Borders founded minware after bootstrapping his previous company to $86m in revenue and selling in 2021, with the idea of helping others benefit from lessons learned growing an engineering team from 0 to 40.


minware is a self-funded seed-stage company. After promising initial customer traction, we are looking for people who share our values to help bring minware to a larger audience.


The Role


As an early engineer, you will have the unique opportunity to work directly with minware's founders to build the product from the ground up. We are looking for someone who enjoys operating in the full stack and learning new things, with an emphasis on using React, GraphQL, and Next.js to build the main analytics application.


We are seeking an ambitious and nice senior engineer who has experience independently executing complex projects and building scalable, maintainable software. As a purveyor of developer productivity analytics, we are diligent about process efficiency and code quality. Though we are small, we try to avoid unnecessarily creating technical debt and are looking for someone who can lead us toward this goal.

Qualifications


Experience building and maintaining a complex full-stack application
Familiarity with principles of high-quality code, including continuous integration, declarative and functional programming
Strong communication skills for interfacing with non-technical stakeholders and occasionally with customers
Well-versed in agile or lean planning and project management processes
Experience with the core stack (Postgres, Next.js, Apollo GraphQL, React) or similar technologies is preferred
Proficiency with infrastructure (AWS, Terraform) and UI (HTML, CSS, Figma) is optional, but nice to have
