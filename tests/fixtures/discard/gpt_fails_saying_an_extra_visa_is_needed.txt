Who we are

Remote work is one of the great equalizers of our time, allowing people to secure employment opportunities from companies around the world, no matter where they were born or where they live. Omnipresent does just that.

We are a customer-focused global employment services partner that can help companies grow their teams in more than 155 countries and territories around the world. How do we do that? Well, through our SaaS platform, OmniPlatform. We help companies (big or small) deal with the complexities involved with hiring global teams remotely, by managing employee onboarding through to offboarding, including legal and compliance, payroll, expenses, and health and benefits.

We also practice what we preach! We are a fully remote company which means we have no head office. Our team of more than 400 people is located in more than 50 countries and territories around the world. This means you can work from anywhere. We provide benefits and support in any global location just as we would for our clients and their remote teams. Our company has a flat structure which means accountability and taking initiative towards your everyday tasks that help further our ambitious company goals.

At a time when remote work is exploding, we’re growing our team to help make global remote work a reality for people everywhere.

The role

The best talent can be found globally, and our product paves the way for a future in which individuals from any corner of the world will enjoy equal access to opportunities.

We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who is hungry to build - this is a fully greenfield opportunity to develop the architecture and core services of our next-generation platform. We’re a 3-year-old series B start-up. Having experienced a lot of growth and market expansion, we've learned some lessons, and we're taking a step back to prepare for a new stage of hypergrowth. This will empower you to engage with every aspect of the product life-cycle, starting from the initial idea to seamless operational delivery.

We are solving an incredibly complex problem

You will put to work your world-class development know-how to deliver greenfield services encompassing global payroll, payments, compliance and benefits across 160+ countries.

This Will Involve

Design, build and improve top-tier services to bring our innovative platform to life
Innovate and bring tech and product ideas to the table, optimising for impact and velocity
Making decisions on technology and tooling, building for scale, security and reliability
Collaborate with cross-functional teams of designers and product managers, full stack, backend and data engineers

What are we looking for?

Extensive experience with Python development.
Possess a deep understanding of modern software engineering design and development principles
Advocate of agile principles and practices and an interest in working in a fast-paced environment
Experience contributing to architectural decisions - you need to care about building solutions that are well designed, built, implemented and that you understand the “why” and “what for”
Experience in designing and implementing microservices and distributed system architectures
Experience with SQL and NoSQL database design using modern technologies
Ability to write clean, maintainable and tested code and services
Hands on experience of deploying and operating in cloud environments

You are the sort of person that...

Has a passion for quality and observability, an ability to understand complex systems and a desire to constantly make things better.
Is passionate not just about working remotely, but evangelizing a new paradigm between employers and employees that decouples geographic location from economic opportunity — improving quality of life for people everywhere.
Has the ability to self-start and you embrace a growth mindset
Invests in the growth of your team and are eager to share knowledge and mentor others
Is pro-active, pragmatic, result-driven, and excited to work in a fast-growing tech scale-up
